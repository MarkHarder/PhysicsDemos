PhysicsDemos
============

An application that demonstrates multiple principles of introductory physics concepts.

####Instructions to Run PhysicsDemos

To run with maven, type the following into the command line while inside the project directory:

```
$ mvn package
```

```
$ java -jar target/demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Click on a demo to run it or 'Quit' to close the application.
Use the up and down arrows to look through the demos.
Pressing escape when a demo is running returns to the menu.

####Some of the demos include:

Fireworks - click anywhere to see velocity and acceleration of particles in three dimensions

Launcher - see four particles launched from the left of the screen. Click to trace the paths of the particles. Particles are attracted to the mouse if they are close enough.

Rain - lots of particles fall from the top of the screen. Your mouse is hydrophobic and pushes the particles away.

Meteor - A particle launches from the top of the screen. Click two points in the window to create a wall there that the particle will bounce off of.

Rocket - Drag the sliders to adjust fuel amount and mass of the rocket. Press space to launch a new rocket.

Cylinder - Drag the sliders to adjust the mass of the cylinder and box. Press space or adjust the sliders to reset the box.

PeriodicWave - Drag the sliders to adjust amplitude and period for red and blue waves. Press '1' or '2' to reverse the wave direction. Press 'q' or 'a' to phase shift either wave to the left. Press 'w' or 's' to phase shift to the right.

Gravitation - Press space to spawn a particle and click and drag the mouse to create a new gravity source.
