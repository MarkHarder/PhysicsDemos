PhysicsDemos
============

An application that demonstrates multiple principles of introductory physics concepts.

####Instructions to Run PhysicsDemos

To run with maven, type the following into the command line while inside the project directory:

```
$ mvn package
```

```
$ java -jar target/demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Click on a demo to run it or 'Quit' to close the application.
Pressing escape when a demo is running returns to the menu.

####Some of the demos include:

Fireworks - click anywhere to see velocity and acceleration of particles in three dimensions

Launcher - see four particles launched from the left of the screen. Click to trace the paths of the particles. Particles are attracted to the mouse if they are close enough.

Rain - lots of particles fall from the top of the screen. Your mouse is hydrophobic and pushes the particles away.

Meteor - A particle launches from the top of the screen. Click two points in the window to create a wall there that the particle will bounce off of.

Rocket - Drag the sliders to adjust fuel amount and mass of the rocket. Press space to launch a new rocket.

Cylinder - Drag the sliders to adjust the mass of the cylinder and box. Press space or adjust the sliders to reset the box.
